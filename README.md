## Objective


## Abstract
This research aims to design and create media applications that will be used to train the speed and accuracy of typing. Lack of instructional media typing speed appropriate to the circumstances in the classroom was the background of this research. 
An application as the research results has main features: the study materials, practice typing, and data management, which each function is executed by the user level use.

### YoloV8 output and GroundingDINO output:



## Results

The proposed system was evaluated on a dataset of video footage. The system was shown to be able to extract license plates with high accuracy. The system was able to extract license plates from a variety of video footage.

## Conclusion

The proposed system is a significant improvement over existing methods for license plate extraction. The system is more accurate and can be used to extract license plates from a wider variety of video footage. The proposed system is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for a variety of applications.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7
* PyTorch
* YoloV8
* GroundingDINO

To try this implementation, clone this repository and change the directory in the 'Vehicle_detection.py' file with the path to your video footage.
